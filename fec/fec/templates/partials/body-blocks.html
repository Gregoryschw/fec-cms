  This partial can be included into content templates with:

    {% include "body-blocks.html" with blocks=self.body %}

  where self.body is a StreamField. The effect is very similar to simply putting
  in the content template:

    {{ self.body }}

  except that this partial allows us to customize the structure, for example
  adding classes or even branching depending on block.block_type.

  Update 04/2021:
    Wagtail did away with the .rich-text wrapper
    but we still have some style rules that rely on it
    so we're adding it back for blocks defined in models.py as RichTextBlock

{% with blocks_name=blocks_name|default:"body" %}

  <div class="{{ blocks_name }}-blocks content__section content__section--narrow">
    {% for block in blocks %}
      <div class="{{ blocks_name }}-block block-{{ block.block_type }}">
        {% if block.block_type == 'paragraph' %}
        <div class="rich-text">{{ block }}</div>
        {% else %}
        {{ block }}
